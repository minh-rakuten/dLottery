Introducing dLottery, a decentralized application designed to bring new and exciting twists to traditional lottery models.

The MVP features two different types of lotteries:
## Spinner Lottery
This is effectively lets users create a reverse lottery. Unlike typical lotteries, where only one lucky person wins, the Spinner can allow everyone to win, except for one or few unlucky people.

## NFT Lottery
Applying same reverse mechanism but features an NFT Lottery, where the offer creator will specify an NFT collection and allow holders of those NFTs to participate.

## Ongoing
Future iterations will include other interesting mechanics such as an open-ended prediction market lottery, which would provide users with a unique opportunity to speculate on outcomes. The offer creator would inputs several fields describing the event, and for arbitration, they will declare an address or choose in-house arbitration. Additionally, features will be implemented to provide users with incentives, such as getting an NFT if they fall under that small percentage of people who lose. With its user-friendly interface, transparent and secure design, and potential for big payouts, dLottery is set to revolutionize the way we think about lotteries on the blockchain.
